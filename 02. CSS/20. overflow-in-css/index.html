        <h1>Overflow in CSS</h1>

        <h2 class="z">1. Overflow: visible</h2>
        <p>By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:</p>
        <div id="visible">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
        
        <h2 class="z">2. Overflow: hidden</h2>
        <p>With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden:</p>
        <p>Try to remove the overflow property to understand how it works.</p>
        <div id="hidden">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
        
        <h2 class="z">3. Overflow: scroll</h2>
        <p>Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):</p>
        <div id="scroll">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>

        <h2 class="z">4. Overflow: auto</h2>
        <p>The auto value is similar to scroll, only it add scrollbars when necessary:</p>
        <div id="auto">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>

        <h2 class="z">5. Overflow-x and overflow-y</h2>
        <p>You can also change the overflow of content horizontally or vertically.</p>
        <p>overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.</p>
        <p>overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.</p>
        <div id="xy">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
